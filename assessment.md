<h1>Assessment of Social Media</h1>
<font size="3.5">All social media platforms have there strong points and weak. Snapchat can be very good for one time event companies such as festivals as others like Instagram allow the company to build up a portfolio. As stated in my video series different sites appeal to different people, such as Facebook has a predominantly older audience while Instgram much younger. All of these factors can be incorporated to allow more accurate advertising campaigns. I would personally recommend that Ada uses: Instagram, Twitter and Facebook as these cover a large age group and allow a portfolio to be kept on each one.</font>
<h2>Instagram</h2>
I added Instagram as it appeal to most students 15/16 looking to go in to college as these people are the primary decision makers. This would allow a for students to do more independent research.
<h2>Twitter</h2>
Twitter is good site to be on to allow the college to reach out to people and keep <b>#alwaysada</b> people informed about current events at the college.
<p></p>
<h2>Facebook</h2>
Facebook often houses community leader and parents these are often the people who make the primary decision maker aware of there choices and will often do first research.</center>
